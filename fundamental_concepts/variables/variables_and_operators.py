# This program shows off variables a some of the operators in python
# By: Nick from CoffeeBeforeArch

# Make variables of each data type
# Dynamically typed (type comes from value assigned)
a = 5
b = "Hello, world!"
c = 4.5

# Print multiple variables  together (separate with commas)
print(a, b, c)

# Print the results of some basic operations
print(a + 5)
print(a * 3)
print(a / 5)
print(a ** 2)

# Comparing two numbers results in a boolean data type
print(type(1 == 1))

# Print the results of some comparisons
print(c <= 4.9)
print(c > 4.5)

# Print the result of the modulo (remainder) operator
print(a % 3)

# Print using a mix of literals and variables
print("A string, ", b, " and an int ", 1)
